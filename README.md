This worldcloud was generated using a mask (basic sun shape from Word: Shapes > Basic Shapes > Sun). The contour width was set to 0, changed the color scheme (this one uses tab20), and set the minimum font size to 8 so that every single word in the worldcloud is readable.

All done in Python. The words were scraped from Reddit user comment data using PRAW, and the image was generated with wordcloud.
